# FA-2-Crypto-Volatility-Visualizer
The Crypto Volatility Visualizer is an interactive Streamlit app that simulates cryptocurrency price movements using mathematical models like sine, cosine, random noise, and drift. It allows users to adjust key parameters to visually explore market volatility, stability, and risk through dynamic real-time graphs.

# Crypto Volatility Visualizer

## Project Overview

The Crypto Volatility Visualizer is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that simulates cryptocurrency price behaviour using mathematical models.

This project demonstrates how sine waves, cosine waves, random noise, amplitude, frequency, and drift can be used to model and visualise market volatility in a simple and interactive way.

The dashboard allows users to explore how mathematical parameters influence cryptocurrency price movements and risk levels.

## Objectives

- Analyse cryptocurrency price behaviour over time  
- Distinguish between stable and volatile assets  
- Apply mathematical functions such as sine, cosine, random noise, and drift  
- Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard  
- Deploy the project using GitHub and Streamlit Cloud

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Timestamp** – Date and time of recorded price  
- **Open** – Price at the beginning of the interval  
- **Close** – Price at the end of the interval  
- **High** – Maximum price during the interval  
- **Low** – Minimum price during the interval  
- **Volume** – Total trading activity during the interval  

The **Close** price is primarily used for price analysis.

## Mathematical Concepts Used

- **Sine Function** – Creates smooth, periodic price cycles  
- **Cosine Function** – Produces shifted periodic movement  
- **Random Noise** – Introduces sudden unpredictable volatility  
- **Amplitude** – Controls the size of price swings  
- **Frequency** – Controls the speed of fluctuations  
- **Drift (Trend)** – Adds long-term upward or downward movement  

These mathematical concepts help simulate stable versus volatile cryptocurrency behaviour.
